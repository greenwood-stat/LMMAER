# Readme for titlepage for PDF version

To get bookdown to recognize the new PDF for the titlepage for the HTML version, you need to set the path in the index.RMD file.

This is currently on line 41. The path for HTML is frontMatter/titlepage_summer_2022.png

You also need a copy of the titlepage saved as a PDF. This copy should be in the base directory. The path is set in preable.tex, currently on line 84. While it is true you can keep overwriting the titlepage.pdf file with the new one, it is better to have a version for each year.
