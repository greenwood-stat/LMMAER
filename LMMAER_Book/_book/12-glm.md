# Generalized linear models {#chapter12}







## Situation {#section12-1}

In Chapter \@ref(chapter4), different types of responses and models for them were discussed. This chapter digs into details and provides of each model. This is meant to be a companion with R code to accompany Chapters ... in the _Statistical Sleuth_ [cite]. The treatment in this chapter will review important aspects of the methods, but focus more on code, visualizations, and output for methods covered in the _Sleuth_.

\indent There is a method that many researchers use to more efficiently generate and 
report these sorts of results that is called a ***compact letter display*** \index{compact letter display}
(CLD, @Piepho2004)^[Note that this method is implemented slightly differently than explained here in some software packages so if you see this in a journal article, read the discussion carefully.]. The ``cld`` function can be applied to the results from
