# Temporal autocorrelation {#chapter10}






## Situation {#section10-1}

The methods in this chapter assume that measurements are taken repeatedly over time, initially on a single subject or location, and measured at a regular time frequency. Once different correlation models are defined, they can be incorporated for longitudinal measurements on multiple subjects to refine our two-level repeated measures models.

\indent There is a method that many researchers use to more efficiently generate and 
report these sorts of results that is called a ***compact letter display*** \index{compact letter display}
(CLD, @Piepho2004)^[Note that this method is implemented slightly differently than explained here in some software packages so if you see this in a journal article, read the discussion carefully.]. The ``cld`` function can be applied to the results from
