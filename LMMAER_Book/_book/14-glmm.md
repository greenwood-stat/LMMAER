## Situation {#section14-1}

In Chapter \@ref(chapter12), generalized linear models are defined and in Chapters..., linear mixed models are discussed. This chapter brings random effects into the GLM framework.

\indent There is a method that many researchers use to more efficiently generate and 
report these sorts of results that is called a ***compact letter display*** \index{compact letter display}
(CLD, @Piepho2004)^[Note that this method is implemented slightly differently than explained here in some software packages so if you see this in a journal article, read the discussion carefully.]. The ``cld`` function can be applied to the results from
